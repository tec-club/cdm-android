Basically a page for me to type out my ideas and design for code and features that I'm going to write

            ****For the background stuff*******
            Using RxJava hopefully to perform parallel asynchronous operations

  ---  I'm going to write a few classes and create a 'parsers' folder in order to scrape data from the schoolloop website once the user has already
    logged in. Goal is to have access to all of the schoolloop data that I or any future dev might need/want to implement a feature.

    One's going to scrape data on which classes the user is taking, their percentage grades, which period they're in, and their teachers, etc... and
    keep those values in a SchoolLoopClass, each object will also contain the current GPA value that class has based off letter grade , AP, and Honors
    The SchoolLoop class will hold all of the data and objects regarding that subject


    One will scrape data on Assignments, their due data, date assigned, their description, teacher, etc... and represent the data as a SchoolLoopAssignmentEvent
    that will extend the CalendarEvent and have a similar SchoolLoopAssignmentEventBuilder to keep consistency

    One will scrape data on all of the assignments for the semester, their percentage and weight value, date, etc ... and represent those in a
    SchoolLoopAssignmentEventMap that will extend CalendarEventMap

    One will obtain data from the student's calendar page, and each item in the calendar will be represented as a SchoolLoopCalendarEvent with date, description,
    and will be contained by the SchoolLoopClass object that submitted the event

   TODO *****For the controllers******
    NOTIFICATION SYSTEM that the user can select to receive various kinds of notifications for that will be toggled in the settings activity.
    Including: events in the RSS Feed, Late Starts, New assignments/calendar event posted (can be toggled for specific classes), assignment score posted (can be toggled
    which type of assignment such as project, assignment, test,assessment etc..) ,  class grade changes (i.e from B- to B+)

    Ability for Staff and ASB to push notifications to app users



    ****For the views*******

    -new views that are in the NavDrawer and display data from the new background html parsers

   Possible ideas include:

   {Taking away the Webview and replacing it with items in the NavDrawer like:
   -A listview that displays each class and basic stats, including scored points/total points
   -clicking on the listview item displays a fragment with recent calendar events, assignment history, and currently assigned homework
   -or other variations of displaying the data in a friendly/more useable manner that is intuitive and doesn't suffer from the effects of
   a poorly written mobile page...
    }
    A grade calculator NavDrawer item, that calculates how many extra credit points away from a specified grade the user is, or how large of an assignment the user is
    away from getting the specified grade, or final grades/weighted grades etc...
    -A trident view that allows users to watch the most recent trident newscast
